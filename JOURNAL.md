## 10/30/2025 - Decided on what engine to purchase and basic purchases  

We decided to use a 212 cc gokart engine. This is fairly fast engine that was made specifically used for gokarts so it was a clear choice. https://www.harborfreight.com/generators-engines/engines/212cc-ghost-kart-racing-engine-57531.html 

The engine is probably the most expensive part of our project but it is also the most important part of it. We are planning to make the frame and decide the materials for it this weekend/next club meeting.

## 11/1/2025 - Found a basic build/Hardware Structure for our Gokart  

We plan to use the following Hand Truck in order to create the gokart. The following video shows a basic idea of what we want to make with it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6HkLMQwlS8

We will still need to freehand the welding and make more space to fit a bigger engine but it's a pretty good alternative. We still need to find steering gear but this is a great start towards our gokart.
