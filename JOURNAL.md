## 10/30/2025 - Decided on what engine to purchase and basic purchases  

We decided to use a 212 cc gokart engine. This is fairly fast engine that was made specifically used for gokarts so it was a clear choice. https://www.harborfreight.com/generators-engines/engines/212cc-ghost-kart-racing-engine-57531.html 

The engine is probably the most expensive part of our project but it is also the most important part of it. We are planning to make the frame and decide the materials for it this weekend/next club meeting.
